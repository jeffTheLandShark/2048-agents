# 2048 AI Project

A flexible 2048 AI research framework supporting multiple agents, heuristic optimization via genetic algorithms, and comprehensive logging/analysis.

## Project Structure

- `game/` - Core game logic and environment
- `agents/` - AI agent implementations (Expectimax, MCTS, Random)
- `heuristics/` - Heuristic feature computation and evaluation
- `ga/` - Genetic algorithm framework for weight optimization
- `logging/` - Statistics logging and ETL utilities
- `experiments/` - Experiment execution and configuration
- `data/` - Raw logs and processed data storage

## Design

See `DESIGN.md` for complete architecture and design documentation.

## Status

This is a skeleton/scaffolding implementation. All modules contain typed stubs with docstrings but no implementation yet.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

(To be implemented)
